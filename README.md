This repository contains two machine learning models that try to reproduce the intermediate scattering functions obtained from Mode Coupling theory. The first model is of a binary mixture and the second is of a single component mixture. 
For the second model, also Shapley values are calculation and there standard deviation is plotted to measure the importance of each of the model input values.
