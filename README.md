# DNN

This repository contains two machine learning models that try to reproduce the intermediate scattering functions obtained from Mode Coupling theory. The first model is of a binary mixture and the second is of a single component mixture. 
For the second model, also Shapley values are calculation and there standard deviation is plotted to measure the importance of each of the model input values.

The models are run by executing the DNN_pytorch.py files.
